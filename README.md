# University_Projects_2022-2025
These are the projects I made during my time at UiB studying IT Security

INF101_Free_Project contains the final project of the Object Oriented programming course. I made a 2D platformer level with some powerups.

INF112_group_project is the group project from the introduction to system development course. I worked on the controller classes, made the graphics and worked on the animation systems for the character and the weather as well as working on organizing the project.
